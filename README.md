## Are welcome, triple build is here

This is simple example how to use CI to build electron app for all target OS.

App will build, when we push to release branch.

travis can build only for os-x and linux systems but for windows need use appveyor.

<!-- both travis and appveyor have simple ways to deploy app but make load builded files to one release from two different servies? -->
